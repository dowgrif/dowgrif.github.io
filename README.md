### What is this and who is this for?

   This is an example of how any person can create a website! On this site you will find an example of a basic website and the instructions to create that website. We will focus on making this website so that you will be able to host your resume on a website. You will then be able to publically display your resume for anyone to see in a way that is convient and does not rely on any type of specific format. Anyone with a web browser will be able to view this easily. 
   Anyone with any level of skill will be able to make use these instructions to create their resume.

### How to create a website to host your resume!

After following these instructions you will have a publicly accessible website that will host your resume.
You will not need any website building or programming experience to for this process
To do so you will need:  
  * To create a resume written in GitHub flavored Markdown format  
  * Create a new GitHub repository to host your website from  
  * Learn to use GitHub pages and Jekyll themes  

  It's simple and looks pretty good! Check mine out [my resume](https://dowgrif.github.io/)


#### Step-by-Step
   1. Using your new found skills write your resume in GitHub markdown format  
     * Use a text editor that provides a preview of the of what the markdown formatted text will look like. [Here are some options](https://www.shopify.ca/partners/blog/10-of-the-best-markdown-editors)  
     * I personally like Atom. The download can be found [here.](https://atom.io/)
   2. Once finished save your resume using index.md as the filename
   3. Sign into your GitHub account
   4. Create a new repository  
     * The easiest way to create a new repository is to click the "+" button in the top right and select new repository  
     * The new repository *must* be named (your username).github.io  
     For example, if your username is Steven your repository would have be named Steven.github.io
   5. Upload the index.md file to the repository
     * Be sure to upload it to the master branch, _otherwise it won't be displayed on the front page_  
   6. Now turn on the GitHub Pages functionality  
     * Navigate to the repository settings from the main page of the repository  
     * Scroll to the GitHub Pages section  
     * From the drop down menu select "master branch" as your source  
     * Select a theme, you can always switch themes later  
     * After selecting a theme your website will start to build itself. This may take a short while.  
     * your website URL will be https://[username].github.io/  
   7. You may edit the automatically generated _config file if you feel the need to do so
     * This step is entirely optional

### Frequently Asked Questions

  #### I don't know how to make websites, can I do this?  
    Yes, using this method you do not need to learn any programming nor do you need to know anything about design. *All* programming and design will be done for you and included in the theme you select.

  #### How do I use Atom to make a markdown file?
      First, you need to open a new file in Atom.
      In the new file open the edit menu then click "Select Grammar"
      From the list select GitHub Markdown
      Before you start press Ctrl+Shift+m to open the preview mode so you can see what the text will look like after the formatting is applied 
      I will unfortunately not be teaching markdown here but the afore mentioned tutorial will get started
