### Instructions to create a static site

After following these instructions you will have a publicly accessible website that will host your resume.

1. Using your know found skills: write your resume in GitHub markdown format  
  * Use a text editor that provides a preview of the of what the markdown formatted text will look like. [Here are some options](https://www.shopify.ca/partners/blog/10-of-the-best-markdown-editors)
  * I personally like Atom. The download can be found [here.](https://atom.io/)
2. Once finished save your resume using index.md as the filename
3. Sign into your GitHub account
4. Create a new repository
  * The new repository *must* be named (your username).github.io  
  For example: dowgrif.githib.io
5. Upload the index.md file to the repository
  * Be sure to upload it to the master branch, _otherwise it won't be displayed on the front page_
6. Now turn on the GitHub Pages functionality  
  * Navigate to the repository settings from the main page of the repository
  * Scroll to the GitHub Pages section
  * From the drop down menu select "master branch" as your source
  * Select a theme, you can always switch themes later
  * After selecting a theme your website will start to build itself. This may take a short while.
  * your website URL will be https://[username].github.io/
7. You may edit the automatically generated _config file
